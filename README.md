# Meme-MultiModal
The growing ubiquity of Internet memes on social media platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Reddit have become a unstoppable trend. Comprising of visual and textual information, memes typically convey various emotion (e.g. humor, sarcasm, offensive, motivational, and sentiment). Nevertheless, there is not much research attention toward meme emotion analysis. The main objective of this project is to bring the attention of the research community toward
meme studying. In this project, we propose the multimodal model newtork for humor detection on .[memotion dataset](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.03781.pdf).
